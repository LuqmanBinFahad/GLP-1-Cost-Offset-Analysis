# Cost Offset Analysis of GLP-1 Agonists in Type 2 Diabetes
This is a single-page interactive web application designed to present the key findings of a retrospective claims study on GLP-1 agonists. The application aims to make complex health economics research accessible and actionable for healthcare payers, managers, and policy-makers. It was authored by Dr. Luqman Bin Fahad.

## Features
Study Overview: An interactive diagram and a concise summary of the study's methodology, cohort selection, and key assumptions.

Key Findings: Dynamic bar charts that allow users to compare GLP-1 agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors on key outcomes, including total healthcare costs, diabetes-related costs, and cardiovascular event rates.

Budget Impact Model: An interactive tool that lets users adjust the number of covered lives to see a projected 12-month cost and clinical impact. This translates the study's findings into a practical, real-world scenario.

Narrative Design: The application's structure is designed as a logical, top-down narrative, guiding the user from the main conclusion to the supporting evidence and finally to the practical implications.

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS, the application is fully responsive and provides an optimal user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack
HTML: The core structure of the single-page application.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Powers all interactive elements, including chart updates, data calculations for the budget model, and navigation.

Chart.js: A powerful and lightweight charting library used to create the dynamic and responsive data visualizations.

## How to Use
Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser. No server or build process is required. All data and logic are contained within the single file, making it easy to share and deploy.
